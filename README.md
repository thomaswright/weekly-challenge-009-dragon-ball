# Weekly Challenge #9 - Dragon Ball

This is a solution for https://github.com/Algorithm-Arena/weekly-challenge-9-dragon-ball.

This is a pretty naive implementation and honestly doesn't result in great placement of the balls ðŸ˜…, but it's a try!

We start with a fibonacci lattice to distribute points around the globe, rotate to the chosen point (by d3's geoRotation), and then search to the closest land mass.
